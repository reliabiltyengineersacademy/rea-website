    content: `
      <h2>Understanding Vibration Analysis</h2>
      <p>Vibration analysis is one of the most powerful and widely used predictive maintenance techniques. It involves measuring and analyzing the vibration patterns of rotating machinery to detect developing faults before they lead to catastrophic failures.</p>
      
      <h2>Basic Principles of Vibration</h2>
      <p>Every rotating machine produces a unique vibration signature based on its design, operating conditions, and mechanical condition. By understanding these signatures, reliability engineers can identify specific fault conditions.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Vibration Parameters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amplitude:</strong> The magnitude of vibration, indicating severity</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> The rate of vibration, indicating fault type</li>
        <li><strong>Phase:</strong> The timing relationship between vibrations at different points</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Common Fault Frequencies</h2>
      <p>Different mechanical faults produce vibrations at characteristic frequencies:</p>
      
      <h3>Imbalance</h3>
      <p>Produces vibration at 1X running speed (fundamental frequency). This is one of the most common faults in rotating machinery and typically shows high radial vibration.</p>
      
      <h3>Misalignment</h3>
      <p>Angular misalignment produces 1X and 2X running speed vibrations, while parallel misalignment primarily produces 2X vibrations with high axial components.</p>
      
      <h3>Bearing Defects</h3>
      <p>Rolling element bearings produce vibrations at specific frequencies based on bearing geometry:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ball Pass Frequency Outer Race (BPFO)</li>
        <li>Ball Pass Frequency Inner Race (BPFI)</li>
        <li>Fundamental Train Frequency (FTF)</li>
        <li>Ball Spin Frequency (BSF)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Gear Defects</h3>
      <p>Gear mesh frequency and its harmonics indicate gear condition. Sidebands around gear mesh frequency can indicate specific gear problems.</p>
      
      <h2>Data Collection Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Successful vibration analysis depends on proper data collection:</p>
      
      <h3>Measurement Locations</h3>
      <p>Establish consistent measurement points on each machine. Typically measure in three directions: horizontal, vertical, and axial at bearing locations.</p>
      
      <h3>Measurement Parameters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frequency Range:</strong> Typically 10 Hz to 10 kHz for most machinery</li>
        <li><strong>Lines of Resolution:</strong> 1600 or 3200 lines for adequate frequency resolution</li>
        <li><strong>Averaging:</strong> Use appropriate averaging to reduce noise</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Analysis Techniques</h2>
      
      <h3>Time Waveform Analysis</h3>
      <p>Provides information about the time-based characteristics of vibration signals. Useful for identifying impacting, modulation, and transient events.</p>
      
      <h3>Frequency Spectrum Analysis</h3>
      <p>Converts time-based signals to frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This is the primary tool for fault identification.</p>
      
      <h3>Envelope Analysis</h3>
      <p>Particularly useful for bearing fault detection. Demodulates high-frequency signals to reveal low-frequency modulation patterns.</p>
      
      <h2>Severity Assessment</h2>
      <p>Vibration severity is typically assessed using standards such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ISO 10816 for machine vibration evaluation</li>
        <li>ISO 20816 for shaft vibration evaluation</li>
        <li>API standards for specific equipment types</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Building a Vibration Program</h2>
      
      <h3>Equipment Selection</h3>
      <p>Choose appropriate vibration analyzers and sensors based on your specific needs and budget. Consider factors like frequency range, dynamic range, and portability.</p>
      
      <h3>Training and Certification</h3>
      <p>Invest in proper training for your team. ISO 18436 provides a framework for vibration analyst certification at multiple levels.</p>
      
      <h3>Database Management</h3>
      <p>Establish a robust database system for storing and trending vibration data. This historical data is crucial for identifying developing problems.</p>
      
      <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
      <p>As your program matures, consider implementing advanced techniques such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Order tracking for variable speed machinery</li>
        <li>Operational deflection shape analysis</li>
        <li>Modal analysis for structural problems</li>
        <li>Automated fault detection algorithms</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <li>Where it happened</li>
        <li>The impact of the failure</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>RCFA Tools and Techniques</h2>
      
      <h3>Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)</h3>
      <p>A top-down approach that starts with the failure event and works backward to identify potential causes. Uses Boolean logic gates to show relationships between events.</p>
      
      <h3>Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)</h3>
      <p>A visual tool that categorizes potential causes into major categories:</p>
